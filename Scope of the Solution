1.Real-time temperature and clock monitoring using sensors and an RTC module.

2.Simulation of the system using Wokwi, enabling virtual prototyping without physical components.

3.Modular code that can be expanded to support:

4.Cloud data transmission (e.g., to ThingSpeak, Blynk).

5.Remote alerts using IoT platforms.

6.Physical hardware implementation.

7.Can be used in smart factories, homes, and server rooms for environmental monitoring.
