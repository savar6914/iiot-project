Industrial and domestic environments require constant temperature monitoring to prevent overheating of sensitive equipment. Manual monitoring is inefficient and error-prone. This project aims to automate this process by:

1.Continuously measuring the temperature in real-time.

2.Displaying the current time and temperature.

3.Generating a warning message when the temperature crosses a critical threshold.

4.Simulating the system virtually to reduce development cost and time.
